Evaluate fingerprinting defenses in Tor Browser

Calculate the amount of entropy reduction by the existing screen resolution countermeasure.
Run simulations with different window resizing parameters and report the entropy of the new distribution (plus some metrics).

Calculations based on Panopticlick database dump found on [Tor Bug Tracker](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/attachment/ticket/4810/panopticlick-screen-resolution-detection.txt).
